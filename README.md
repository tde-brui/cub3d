# Cub3d - Raycasting game
Welcome to cub3d! A raycasting project created for the 42 school curriculum.
This project uses a raycasting algorithm to simulate a 3D environment using a 2D space, fully coded in C.
Using the MLX42 library.

## Features
~ Wall collisions.

~ Wall, ceiling and floor textures.

~ Player control.

## Structure of the project
~ src/*      Contains the C source files.

~ inc/*      Contains the header files.

~ textures/* Contains png images that can be used to display textures on the walls.

~ Makefile   A Makefile that compiles the project.

1. [Install necessary dependencies] (MLX42 github page).
2. clone this repository: "git clone https://github.com/tde-brui/cub3d.git".
3. Compile the code using the Makefile: "make".
4. Run the code!: "./cub3d <testfile with .cub extension>".
